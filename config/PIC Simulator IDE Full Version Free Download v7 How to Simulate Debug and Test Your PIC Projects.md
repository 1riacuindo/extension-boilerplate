# PIC Simulator IDE: A Powerful Development Environment for Microchip Microcontrollers
 
If you are looking for a user-friendly graphical development environment for Windows with integrated simulator (emulator), pic basic compiler, assembler, disassembler and debugger for Microchip microcontrollers, you may want to check out PIC Simulator IDE. This software supports the extensive number of microcontrollers (MCUs) from the Microchip 8-bit PIC Mid-Range architecture product line (selected PIC16F, PIC12F, PIC10F models) [^1^] [^2^].

PIC Simulator IDE allows you to create, test, deploy, and debug applications for the Microchip 8-bit PIC Mid-Range architecture product line. You can edit the FLASH program memory, EEPROM data memory, and hardware stack of the microcontroller. You can also simulate the digital I/O and analog inputs of the microcontroller pinout interface. Moreover, you can use simulation stimulus files to define and manage the changes on digital and analog inputs at desired real time moments during the code simulation with execution tracking [^2^].
 
PIC Simulator IDE also provides you with a powerful PIC Basic compiler with smart Basic source editor. The PIC Basic compiler supports various data types, arrays, strings, procedures, functions, Modbus master/slave implementation, MMC/SD/SDSC/SDHC cards interfacing (with FAT16 and FAT32 file system support), internal EEPROM memory, internal A/D converter module, interrupts, serial communication using internal hardware UART or software UART, I2C communication with external I2C devices, Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication, character LCDs interfacing, graphical LCDs interfacing with 128x64 dot matrix, R/C servos, stepper motor control, 1-Wire devices, DS18S20, internal PWM modules, and more [^2^]. You can also use the PIC Basic Compiler Library Support for additional features [^2^]. Furthermore, you can implement PID Controller (with the auto tuning feature) in the basic compiler and use the PID Controller Process Simulator to test it [^2^].
 
PIC Simulator IDE also offers other useful tools such as configuration bits editor, PC's serial port terminal for communication with real devices connected to serial port, LCD module simulation interface for character LCD modules, and graphical LCD module simulation interface for 128x64 graphical LCD modules [^2^].
 
If you are interested in PIC Simulator IDE, you can download the fully functional evaluation copy of the software on the downloads page [^2^]. The evaluation copy is free to use for a limited period of time. If you want to continue using the software after the evaluation period, you need to purchase a license. For more information about the license and pricing, please visit the licenses page [^2^].
