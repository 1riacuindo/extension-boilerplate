Call of Duty: Black Ops II is not only a thrilling shooter game, but also a game that offers meaningful innovation to the Call of Duty franchise. One of the main features of the game is the branching storyline, which is driven by the player's choices and actions. The game features two time periods: the late 1980s and 2025. In the 1980s, the player controls Alex Mason and Frank Woods, who are pursuing Raul Menendez, a ruthless drug lord and terrorist leader. In 2025, the player controls David Mason, Alex's son, who is also hunting down Menendez, who has sparked a new Cold War between the United States and China.
 
The game also features special Strike Force missions, which are nonlinear and sandbox-like scenarios that can affect the outcome of the game. The player can choose to play as a soldier, a drone operator, or an overwatch commander, and switch between them at any time. The missions have different objectives and consequences depending on the player's performance and decisions. The game also has multiple endings, which are determined by factors such as the success or failure of the Strike Force missions, the choices made by the player during key moments, and the relationship between the characters.
 
Another feature of Call of Duty: Black Ops II is the multiplayer mode, which introduces some of the most advanced weaponry and equipment that 2025 will have to offer. The multiplayer mode also features a new system called \"Pick 10\", which allows the player to customize their loadout with any 10 items, regardless of their category. The multiplayer mode also introduces new game modes, such as \"Hardpoint\", \"Kill Confirmed\", and \"Multi-Team\", as well as new scorestreaks, such as \"Dragonfire\", \"Warthog\", and \"Lodestar\".
