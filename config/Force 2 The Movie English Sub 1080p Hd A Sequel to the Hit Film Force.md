He teams up with a RAW agent named KK (Sonakshi Sinha) and a hacker named Shiv (Tahir Raj Bhasin) to track down the mastermind behind the conspiracy.

Some of the highlights of Force 2 are the performances by the lead actors. John Abraham delivers a solid performance as Yash, the tough and determined ex-cop who is driven by his sense of duty and loyalty. He showcases his physical prowess and charisma in the action scenes, and also displays some emotional depth in the scenes where he mourns his friend's death. Sonakshi Sinha is equally impressive as KK, the smart and brave RAW agent who supports Yash in his mission. She proves her versatility as an actress by playing a different role from her usual masala movies. She also holds her own in the action scenes, and shares a good chemistry with John Abraham. Tahir Raj Bhasin is the surprise package of Force 2. He plays Shiv, the cunning and ruthless hacker who is behind the spy killings. He portrays his character with a lot of flair and finesse, and makes him a worthy adversary for Yash and KK. He also adds some humor and sarcasm to the otherwise serious movie.
 
Another aspect of Force 2 that deserves praise is the music by Gourov Roshin and Amaal Mallik. The movie has four songs that are catchy and well-placed in the narrative. The title track Force 2 is a powerful and energetic song that sets the tone for the movie. Rang Laal is a patriotic and motivational song that features John Abraham's voice along with Dev Negi and Aditi Singh Sharma. O Janiya is a remix of Kaate Nahin Kat Te from Mr. India, and is a sensuous and stylish song that features Sonakshi Sinha's dance moves. Ishaara is a romantic and melodious song that showcases the bond between Yash and KK, sung by Armaan Malik.

Force 2 is not without its flaws, however. The movie suffers from some logical loopholes and clichÃ©s that are common in spy movies. For instance, how does Yash manage to survive multiple gunshots and explosions without any serious injuries? How does Shiv hack into any system or device without any difficulty or security? How does KK get access to any weapon or vehicle she needs without any authorization or verification? How does the mole operate from the Indian embassy without being detected or exposed? These are some of the questions that might bother you if you look for logic or realism in Force 2.
 
Nevertheless, Force 2 is a movie that delivers what it promises: a thrilling and entertaining spy movie with English subtitles that will keep you engaged till the end. If you are looking for a fun and action-packed Bollywood movie with English subtitles, you should definitely watch Force 2 on Netflix.
