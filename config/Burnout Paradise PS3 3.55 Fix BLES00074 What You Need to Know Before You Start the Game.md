In this article, we will show you how to fix Burnout Paradise on PS3 3.55 firmware using a patch file that was created by some modders. This patch file will modify the game's files to make it compatible with the custom firmware. You will need a PS3 with firmware 3.55 or lower, a USB drive, and a copy of Burnout Paradise with the region code BLES00074.
 
## Step 1: Download the Patch File
 
The first step is to download the patch file that will fix Burnout Paradise on PS3 3.55 firmware. You can find the patch file on various websites, such as [opensea.io](https://opensea.io/collection/burnout-paradise-ps3-355-fix-bles00074) [^1^], [irtsy.com](https://irtsy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnout\_paradise\_PS3\_355\_fix\_BLES00074.pdf) [^2^], or [indoretalk.com](https://indoretalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Burnout\_Paradise\_PS3\_355\_Fix\_BLES00074.pdf) [^3^]. The patch file is usually in a ZIP or RAR format, so you will need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
 
## Step 2: Copy the Patch File to Your USB Drive
 
The next step is to copy the patch file to your USB drive. You will need to create a folder named "GAMEZ" on the root of your USB drive, and then create another folder inside it with the same name as your game's region code, which is BLES00074 for Burnout Paradise. Inside this folder, you will need to copy the patch file, which should have a name like "BLES00074.Burnout.Paradise.PS3.Fix.rar".
 
## Step 3: Install the Patch File on Your PS3
 
The final step is to install the patch file on your PS3. You will need to connect your USB drive to your PS3 and then launch a program called Multiman, which is a file manager and backup manager for PS3. You can find Multiman on various websites, such as [psx-place.com](https://www.psx-place.com/resources/multiman-webman-mod-combo-for-cfw-ps3hen.1149/) or [psx-scene.com](http://www.psx-scene.com/forums/content/multiman-4-82-00-deank-4679/). Once you launch Multiman, you will need to navigate to your USB drive and select the patch file that you copied earlier. Then, you will need to press X to install it. This will overwrite some of the game's files with the patched ones.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy Burnout Paradise on PS3 3.55 Firmware
 
After installing the patch file, you can enjoy Burnout Paradise on PS3 3.55 firmware without any issues. You can launch the game from Multiman or from the XMB (the main menu of the PS3). You should be able to play all the modes and features of the game, including online multiplayer and downloadable content.
