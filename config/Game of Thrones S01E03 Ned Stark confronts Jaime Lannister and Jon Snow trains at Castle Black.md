In the third episode of the first season, titled "Lord Snow", Ned Stark (Sean Bean) arrives at King's Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, to serve as the Hand of the King to his old friend Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy). He is shocked to discover the corruption and debt that plague the realm, and faces opposition from Robert's wife Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) and her powerful family. Meanwhile, his daughters Sansa (Sophie Turner) and Arya (Maisie Williams) have to adjust to their new surroundings and roles. Sansa dreams of becoming a queen, while Arya prefers sword-fighting and adventure.
 
On the other side of the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) continues her journey with her husband Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa) and his Dothraki horde. She learns more about their culture and customs, and begins to assert herself as a khaleesi. She also discovers that she is pregnant with Drogo's child, who is prophesied to be the "stallion who mounts the world".
 
At the Wall, Jon Snow (Kit Harington), Ned's bastard son, trains to become a member of the Night's Watch, a sworn brotherhood that guards the realm from the dangers beyond. He befriends Samwell Tarly (John Bradley), a timid and overweight recruit who is bullied by others. He also learns more about the history and secrets of the Wall from his mentors Jeor Mormont (James Cosmo) and Maester Aemon (Peter Vaughan).
 
"Lord Snow" is a well-written and well-acted episode that develops the characters and the plot further. It introduces some new faces, such as Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen), Varys (Conleth Hill), and Syrio Forel (Miltos Yerolemou), who will play important roles in the future. It also foreshadows some events that will have major consequences later on. The episode balances drama, humor, action, and mystery, and keeps the viewers engaged and entertained.

The episode also has some memorable scenes and quotes, such as:
 
- Ned's reunion with his old friend and mentor Jon Arryn's widow Lysa (Kate Dickie), who has become paranoid and obsessed with protecting her son Robin (Lino Facioli), a sickly and spoiled boy who still breastfeeds at the age of eight.
- Ned's confrontation with Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), the Kingslayer who killed the previous king and Cersei's twin brother and lover. Jaime blames Ned for the death of his men, who were killed by Ned's wife Catelyn (Michelle Fairley) when she captured Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage), Jaime's younger brother and a witty dwarf who is accused of plotting to kill Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright), Ned's youngest son who was pushed from a tower by Jaime.
- Arya's first lesson with Syrio Forel, a former swordmaster of Braavos who teaches her how to fight with a thin blade called Needle. Syrio tells Arya that she must be swift as a deer, quiet as a shadow, calm as still water, and fearless as a wolf. He also teaches her the mantra "Not today", which she must say when death comes for her.
- Daenerys' gift of three dragon eggs from Illyrio Mopatis (Roger Allam), a wealthy merchant who arranged her marriage to Drogo. The eggs are said to be petrified and worthless, but Daenerys senses a strange connection to them. She also receives a visit from her brother Viserys (Harry Lloyd), the last male heir of the Targaryen dynasty that was overthrown by Robert. Viserys is impatient and abusive, and threatens to cut Daenerys' unborn child out of her if she does not help him reclaim the Iron Throne.
- Jon's vow to protect Sam from the other recruits, who mock him for his cowardice and lack of skill. Jon convinces his friends Grenn (Mark Stanley) and Pyp (Josef Altin) to stop harassing Sam, and earns the respect of Ser Alliser Thorne (Owen Teale), the harsh master-at-arms who trains the new recruits. Jon also receives a letter from his brother Robb (Richard Madden), who tells him that Bran has woken up from his coma but has lost the use of his legs.

"Lord Snow" is a great example of how Game of Thrones can weave multiple storylines and characters into a cohesive and captivating narrative. It sets up the stage for the upcoming conflicts and challenges that will test the loyalty, honor, and courage of the characters. It also showcases the rich and diverse world of Westeros and beyond, where magic, dragons, and ice zombies are as real as politics, war, and love.
