Matrox Imaging Library (MIL) 9.0 C is a software development kit (SDK) that provides a wide range of tools for developing machine vision, image analysis, and medical imaging applications. MIL 9.0 C includes tools for every step in the process, from application feasibility to prototyping, through to development and ultimately deployment. The SDK features interactive software and programming functions for image capture, processing, analysis, annotation, display, and archiving.
 
MIL 9.0 C is designed to enhance productivity, thereby reducing the time and effort required to bring solutions to market. Image capture, processing, and analysis operations have the accuracy and robustness needed to tackle the most demanding applications. These operations are also carefully optimized for speed to address the severe time constraints encountered in many applications.

MIL 9.0 C supports platforms ranging from smart cameras to high-performance computing (HPC) clusters via a single consistent and intuitive application programming interface (API). The API is portable across different video interfaces and operating systems, providing platform flexibility and protecting the original development investment. MIL 9.0 C also supports .NET development, JIT compilation, scripting, multi-tasking, buffers and containers, saving and loading data, and configuration and diagnostic tools.
 
MIL 9.0 C is based on MIL X[^1^], a comprehensive collection of software tools for machine vision and image analysis that has a more than 25-year history of reliable performance. MIL X is maintained and developed using industry recognized best practices by a team of dedicated, highly skilled computer scientists, mathematicians, software engineers, and physicists.
 
MIL 9.0 C users can benefit from Matrox Vision Academy online and on-premises training[^1^], software updates[^3^], and technical support[^3^]. MIL 9.0 C is available as a free download[^3^] for both application development and deployment.
