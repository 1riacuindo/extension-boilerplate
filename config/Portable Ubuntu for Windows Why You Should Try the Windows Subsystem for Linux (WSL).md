Both versions have pros and cons. Wubiuefi is easier to use and more integrated with Windows, but it requires a reboot every time you want to switch between Ubuntu and Windows. LinuxLive USB Creator is more flexible and allows you to run Ubuntu without rebooting, but it requires more configuration and may not work on some computers.
 
You can download Wubiuefi from [https://github.com/hakuna-m/wubiuefi/releases](https://github.com/hakuna-m/wubiuefi/releases) and LinuxLive USB Creator from [https://www.linuxliveusb.com/](https://www.linuxliveusb.com/). You will also need to download an Ubuntu ISO file from [https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Choose the latest LTS (long-term support) version for better stability and compatibility.
 
## Step 2: Install Portable Ubuntu for Windows
 
The second step is to install portable Ubuntu for Windows on your USB flash drive or external hard drive. Depending on which version you downloaded, the installation process may vary slightly.
 
If you downloaded Wubiuefi, you just need to run the executable file and follow the instructions. You will be asked to select the drive where you want to install Ubuntu, the size of the installation, the username and password, and the language. You can also choose whether to install alongside Windows or replace it entirely. We recommend choosing the "Install inside Windows" option to keep your Windows system intact.
 
If you downloaded LinuxLive USB Creator, you need to run the program and select your USB flash drive or external hard drive as the destination. Then, click on the ISO button and browse to the Ubuntu ISO file that you downloaded. Next, click on the lightning icon and wait for the process to finish. You can also customize some settings such as persistence (which allows you to save changes across sessions) and virtualization (which allows you to run Ubuntu inside Windows).
 
## Step 3: Run Portable Ubuntu for Windows
 
The third step is to run portable Ubuntu for Windows from your USB flash drive or external hard drive. Depending on which version you installed, the way to do this may differ slightly.
 
If you installed Wubiuefi, you need to reboot your computer and choose "Ubuntu" from the boot menu. You will be greeted by the Ubuntu desktop and you can start using it as normal. To switch back to Windows, you need to reboot again and choose "Windows" from the boot menu.
 
If you installed LinuxLive USB Creator, you can either reboot your computer and choose "LinuxLive USB Creator" from the boot menu, or run it from within Windows by clicking on the "Virtualize This Key" button in the program. You will be able to use Ubuntu without rebooting or affecting your Windows system.
