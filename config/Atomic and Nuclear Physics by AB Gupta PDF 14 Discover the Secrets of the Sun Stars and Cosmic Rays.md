If you are looking for a book that covers the fundamentals and applications of atomic and nuclear physics, you might want to check out **Atomic and Nuclear Physics by A.B. Gupta**. This book is written by a renowned physicist and professor who has more than three decades of teaching and research experience in this field. It is designed for the students majoring in Physics (CBCS, Hons./Major) and also of Engineering and allied disciplines.
 
The book is divided into two sections: Atomic Physics and Nuclear Physics. The first section covers topics such as special relativity, ions and electrons, particle nature of radiation, atomic models, matter waves, quantum mechanics, atomic physics, molecular spectra, laser and holography, fibre optics, and atom laser basics. The second section covers topics such as general properties of nuclei, radioactivity, radiation detectors, alpha-beta-gamma rays, particle accelerators, nuclear reactions, neutron physics and nuclear energy, nuclear models, nuclear force and two-body problem, cosmic rays, and elementary particles.

In this article, we will review some of the main topics covered in **Atomic and Nuclear Physics by A.B. Gupta**. We will also highlight some of the key features and benefits of this book for the readers.
 
## Special Relativity
 
One of the first topics that the book introduces is special relativity, which is a theory that describes how space and time are related in different frames of reference. The book explains the basic concepts and principles of special relativity, such as the postulates of relativity, the Lorentz transformation, the relativistic kinematics and dynamics, the mass-energy equivalence, and the length contraction and time dilation. The book also shows how special relativity applies to various phenomena, such as the Doppler effect, the twin paradox, the relativistic addition of velocities, and the relativistic energy and momentum.
 
## Ions and Electrons
 
The next topic that the book covers is ions and electrons, which are two types of charged particles that play an important role in atomic and nuclear physics. The book discusses the properties and interactions of ions and electrons, such as their charge, mass, spin, magnetic moment, electric field, electric potential, electric dipole moment, and electric polarization. The book also explains how ions and electrons can be produced and detected by various methods, such as ionization, photoelectric effect, thermionic emission, field emission, secondary emission, electron diffraction, electron microscopy, and electron spectroscopy.
 
## Particle Nature of Radiation
 
The third topic that the book deals with is particle nature of radiation, which is a concept that reveals that electromagnetic radiation can behave like a stream of particles called photons. The book explores the evidence and implications of particle nature of radiation, such as the Planck's quantum theory, the Einstein's photoelectric equation, the Compton effect, the pair production and annihilation, the photon statistics and distribution, and the photon polarization and scattering. The book also compares and contrasts particle nature of radiation with wave nature of radiation, which is another concept that describes how electromagnetic radiation can behave like a wave.
