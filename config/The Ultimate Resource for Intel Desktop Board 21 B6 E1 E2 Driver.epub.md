One of the advantages of the Intel Desktop Board 21 B6 E1 E2 is that it supports Intel Rapid Storage Technology, which allows you to create RAID arrays with your SATA drives. RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks, and it is a way of combining multiple drives into one logical unit that can improve performance, reliability or both. For example, you can use RAID 0 to split data across two or more drives and increase the speed of data transfer, or you can use RAID 1 to mirror data across two or more drives and increase the security of data backup. You can also use RAID 5 or 10 to combine both benefits.
 
To use Intel Rapid Storage Technology, you need to install the Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver and software from the Intel website. You also need to enter the BIOS setup and enable the RAID mode for your SATA ports. Then, you can use the Intel Rapid Storage Technology software to create and manage your RAID arrays. You can also monitor the status and health of your drives and arrays using this software.

To use Intel Smart Connect Technology, you need to install the Intel Smart Connect Technology driver and software from the Intel website. You also need to enable this feature in the BIOS setup and in the Windows power options. Then, you can select which applications you want to update in sleep mode using the Intel Smart Connect Technology software.
