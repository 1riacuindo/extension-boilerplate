## What is USACE CWALSHT Retaining Wall Design Full Version?
 
USACE CWALSHT Retaining Wall Design Full Version is a software that allows you to design and analyze retaining walls using the CWALSHT method. The CWALSHT method is a limit state design approach that considers the strength and stability of the wall, the soil, and the external loads. The method also uses a hyperbolic tangent function to model the soil-wall interaction, which accounts for the nonlinear behavior of the soil.

With USACE CWALSHT Retaining Wall Design Full Version, you can design and analyze cantilever retaining walls, counterfort retaining walls, and sheet pile walls. You can also perform parametric studies to optimize your design and compare different wall types and configurations. The software can handle various soil types, such as cohesive, granular, layered, or mixed soils. You can also specify different loading conditions, such as surcharge loads, seismic loads, water pressures, or earth pressures.
 
## How to Use USACE CWALSHT Retaining Wall Design Full Version?
 
To use USACE CWALSHT Retaining Wall Design Full Version, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install the software on your computer. You can download it from [the official website](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/Fact-Sheets/Fact-Sheet-Article-View/Article/476794/cwalsht/) of the USACE Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC). The software is compatible with Windows operating systems.
2. Launch the software and create a new project. You can name your project and choose the units of measurement.
3. Select the wall type that you want to design and analyze. You can choose from cantilever wall, counterfort wall, or sheet pile wall.
4. Enter the geometry and material properties of the wall. You can specify the dimensions, reinforcement, concrete strength, steel grade, etc.
5. Enter the soil properties and layering. You can define the soil type, unit weight, cohesion, friction angle, modulus of elasticity, Poisson's ratio, etc. You can also specify the number and thickness of soil layers.
6. Enter the loading conditions. You can define the surcharge load magnitude and location, water table depth and pressure coefficient, seismic coefficient and direction, earth pressure coefficient and direction, etc.
7. Run the analysis and view the results. The software will calculate the internal forces, moments, stresses, strains, displacements, factors of safety, etc. for your wall design. You can view the results in graphical or tabular formats.
8. Modify your design parameters and run the analysis again if needed. You can perform parametric studies to optimize your design and compare different wall types and configurations.
9. Save your project and generate a report. You can export your project data and results to a text file or a spreadsheet file. You can also generate a report that summarizes your design inputs and outputs in a printable format.
